                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    With the growing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), connected devices have penetrated every
                    aspect of our life, from health and fitness, home automation, automotive and logistics, to smart
                    cities and industrial IoT.<br><br>
                    Thus, it is only logical that IoT, connected devices, and automation would find its application in
                    agriculture, and as such, tremendously improve nearly every facet of it. How could one still rely on
                    horses and plows when self-driving cars and virtual reality are no longer a sci-fi fantasy but an
                    everyday occurrence?<br><br>

                    Farming has seen a number of technological transformations in the last decades, becoming more
                    industrialized and technology-driven. By using various smart agriculture gadgets, farmers have
                    gained better control over the process of raising livestock and growing crops, making it more
                    predictable and improving its efficiency.<br><br>

                    This, along with the growing consumer demand for agriculture products, has contributed to the
                    increased proliferation of smart farming technologies worldwide. In 2022, the market share for IoT
                    in agriculture reached $13.76 billion.<br><br>

                    In this article, we will explore the IoT use cases in agriculture and examine their benefits. So, if
                    you are considering investing into smart farming, or are planning to build an IoT solution for
                    agriculture, dive right in.

                <h2>What is smart agriculture?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to refer to modern agriculture. For example, AgriTech refers to the application
                    of technology in agriculture in general.<br><br>
                    Smart agriculture, on the other hand, is mostly used to denote the application of IoT solutions in
                    agriculture. So what is smart agriculture using IoT? By using IoT sensors to collect environmental
                    and machine metrics, farmers can make informed decisions, and improve just about every aspect of
                    their work – from livestock to crop farming.<br><br>
                    <img src="../asserts/img/1.jpg" alt="img">
                    For example, by using smart agriculture sensors to monitor the state of crops, farmers can define
                    exactly how many pesticides and fertilizers they have to use to reach optimal efficiency. The same
                    applies to the smart farming definition.<br><br>
                    Namely, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT in the agriculture market share. Disruptions in
                    the supply chain, and the shortage of qualified workers, has propelled its CAGR to 9,9%. In fact, as
                    per recent reports, the smart framing market share is set to reach $28.56 billion by 2030.<br><br>

                    At the same time, the global smart agriculture market size is expected to triple by 2025, reaching
                    $15.3 billion (compared to being slightly over $5 billion back in 2016).<br><br>

                    Because the market is still developing, there is still ample opportunity for businesses willing to
                    join in. Building IoT products for agriculture within the coming years can set you apart as an early
                    adopter, and as such, help you pave the way to success.<br><br>

                <p>
                    There are many types of IoT sensors for agriculture as well as IoT applications in agriculture in
                    general:

                <h2> 1. Monitoring of climate conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    Typically, farmers use manual intervention to control the greenhouse environment. The use of IoT
                    sensors enables them to get accurate real-time information on greenhouse conditions such as
                    lighting, temperature, soil condition, and humidity.<br><br>

                    For instance, Farmapp and Growlink are also IoT agriculture products offering such capabilities
                    among others.

                <h2> 2. Greenhouse automation</h2>
                <p>
                    Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart
                    farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send
                    it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the
                    appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e. precision
                    farming).<br><br>

                    Some examples of such agriculture IoT devices are allMETEO, Smart Elements, and Pycno.

                <h2> 3. Crop management</h2>
                <p>
                    One more type of IoT product in agriculture and another element of precision farming are crop
                    management devices. Just like weather stations, they should be placed in the field to collect data
                    specific to crop farming; from temperature and precipitation to leaf water potential and overall
                    crop health.<br><br>

                    hus, you can monitor your crop growth and any anomalies to effectively prevent any diseases or
                    infestations that can harm your yield. Arable and Semios can serve as good representations of how
                    this use case can be applied in real life.

                <h2>1. The hardware</h2>
                <p>
                    To build an IoT solution for agriculture, you need to choose the sensors for your device (or create
                    a custom one). Your choice will depend on the types of information you want to collect and the
                    purpose of your solution in general.<br><br>

                    In any case, the quality of your sensors is crucial to the success of your product: it will depend
                    on the accuracy of the collected data and its reliability.

                <h2>2. The maintenance</h2>
                <p>
                    Maintenance of your hardware is a challenge that is of primary importance for IoT products in
                    agriculture, as the sensors are typically used in the field and can be easily damaged.<br><br>

                    Thus, you need to make sure your hardware is durable and easy to maintain. Otherwise you will need
                    to replace your sensors more often than you would like.
                </p>

                <h2>3. The mobility</h2>
                <p>
                    Smart farming applications should be tailored for use in the field. A business owner or farm manager
                    should be able to access the information on site or remotely via a smartphone or desktop
                    computer.<br><br>

                    Plus, each connected device should be autonomous and have enough wireless range to communicate with
                    the other devices and send data to the central server.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>4. The infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure that your smart farming application performs well (and to make sure it can handle the data
                    load), you need a solid internal infrastructure.<br><br>

                    Furthermore, your internal systems have to be secure. Failing to properly secure your system only
                    increases the likeliness of someone breaking into it, stealing your data or even taking control of
                    your autonomous tractors.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>5. Connectivity</h2>
                <p>
                    The need to transmit data between many agricultural facilities still poses a challenge for the
                    adoption of smart farming. Needless to say, the connection between these facilities should be
                    reliable enough to withstand bad weather conditions and to ensure non-disruptive operations.<br><br>

                    Today, IoT devices still use varying connection protocols, although the efforts to develop unified
                    standards in this area are currently underway. The advent of 5G and technologies like space-based
                    Internet will, hopefully, help find a solution to this problem.
